Q Type your question
finches with large, thick beaks survived
the drought as they subsisted on cactus, which are drought tolerant
plants.

In the early 1980 's, the Galapagos
Islands underwent an El Nino event that
led to higher annual levels of
precipitation than normal. This climate
event occurred just a few years after the
drought. The increase in rainfall led to a
dramatic increase in growth of seed-
producing plants, which led to an abundance of foods for seed-eating
finches, which have small, short beaks.
The increase in rainfall also decreased
the availability of cactuses on the islands. Which of the following would
you predict occurred in the finch population as a result of the second
change in climate?",The variety present in the finch population did not change due to changes in climate,The population of short-beaked finches increased while the population of large beaked birds decreased.,The number of finches of each type both decreased due to the change in climate,The large-beaked finches increased in number while the short-beaked finches decreased in number,The large-beaked finches hybridized with the shortbeaked finches.,,

flowers and fruits, and it plays a major role in fruit ripening, flowering and abscission (the natural shedding of leaves, flowers and fruits). The
biosynthesis of ethylene in plant cells
occurs in a two-step biochemical pathway illustrated in figure below:
Figure : Ethylene biosynthesis starts when S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is converted to 1-aminocyclopropane-1carboxylic acid (ACC) by the enzyme ACC synthase (ACS). ACC is then converted to ethylene by the enzyme ACC oxidase (ACO). The ACS and ACO
genes are expressed in response to internal developmental cues and
environmental stresses, such as
wounding, flooding, drought, and
pathogen attack. Atta-Aly, Brecht and Huber (2000) researched ethylene feedback mechanisms in tomato and strawberry fruit tissues. Their studies revealed that
immature fruit had a reduced
concentration of ACC when exposed to ethylene gas, but ethylene application on mature fruit increased ACC oxidase
(ACO) activity.
Which statement best explains how different plant tissues respond to
ethylene gas?",Ethylene gas serves as a positive feedback signal in immature fruit and a negative feedback signal in mature fruit.,Exposure to ethylene gas results in a negative feedback loop in both immature and mature fruit,Exposure to ethylene gas results in a positive feedback loop in both immature and it,Ethylene gas serves as a negative feedback signal in immature fruit and a positive feedback signal in mature fruit.,,,
